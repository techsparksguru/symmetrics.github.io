title: DATA POLICY
---

# Authentic
- We do NOT use any user submitted data (like most portal out there do);
- User submitted data is NOT necessarily verified and hence metrics or stats drawn on top of inaccurate data is inaccurate;
- Even if some of our competitors claim they VERIFY user submitted data, at best they verify few records which might erode the confidence in data. At worst, we do not know what percentage of the data points are verified and what are NOT. That casts a lot of doubt on the veracity of the data and the metrics derived out of it
- <strong>Symmetrics</strong> data is fully authentic and in official records, so there is almost zero chance of casting doubt on the quality of the data

# Public Disclosure
- We used public disclosure data published by USCIS for high skilled programs and other work visas
- As per PEW research, the data is almost 18-20% of all salaries reported for high skilled workers in the United States. There are approximately 11.7million high skilled workers in the US
- All of our competitors have sample sets and that means analytics run on sample sets can be compared to "in the eyes of beholder"

# Clean Data
- We spent a lot of time cleaning and organizing the data
- The DWH (data warehouse) we built is based on modern tech stacks that are designed to handle big-data workloads
- Symmetrics uses only CLEANED DATA for querying and analysis, hence is relatively trustworthy and reliable than other source on the internet in this segment
