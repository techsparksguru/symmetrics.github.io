The information provided on this web site may not apply to any particular set of facts or circumstances.

Symmetrics.fyi does NOT represent any visitors in any manner. No one at Symmetrics.fyi practices law and no one from Symmetrics.fyi would ever charge any money for providing immigration advice specific to your needs and/or circumstances.

Please understand that your specific legal questions cannot be resolved simply by reference to content and data presented on this web site. The particular facts involved in your situation will determine how the law applies to you. In addition, laws change often and vary among different jurisdictions, so the information contained on this web site may not be what applies to you.

# Proof on government web sites

We routinely get inquiries from people that question the authenticity of the information posted on this web site and ask us to show the corresponding content on the official government web site.

Please note that we are unable to fulfill such requests for several obvious reasons. First and foremost, if everything you needed to know about the labor market and immigration process were readily available on the government web sites, there would be no reason for web sites like Symmetrics.fyi to exist in the first place. In that case, we would simply be copying the content from government web sites and displaying it on our web site, providing no additional value to the reader and no one would have any reason to visit our web site.

The fact remains that the government contents and data are often incomplete, confusing, contradicting, and may have a lot of legal jargon that an average reader may not understand. The information and data on our web site is presented in such a way that it is easy to read and and is an understandable comprehensive guide for various aspects of primarily U.S. immigration and visas. We refer to numerous sources such as government web sites, law publications, news channels, our own experience, the experiences of the users of our own web sites, and other sources of information that we possibly and legally can. Therefore, the content on our web site is a result of a lot of legal research, hard work, and of course not found anywhere else already ready made on any government web site.

Of course, we try to maintain the web site to the best of our abilities and try to provide the accurate and up to date information but there are no guarantees.

If you wish to rely only on official government content, this web site is not intended for you. Please contact the concerned government department directly such as the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Department of State, or U.S. embassy/consulate. Please contact your attorney for further information.
